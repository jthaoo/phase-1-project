# Hello there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Johnathan!

This is my Phase 1 Project

- A Superhero App I've made providing the best of all superheros on the internet in one place! I decided to make an API (Application Programming Interface) pulling up random superheros because I've always grown up loving superheros and always had an intrest in them.
